The past few months have been exciting for 6to5. It’s gone from being an educational project to having 100k downloads on npm. There have been 1,800 commits and 155 releases. 6to5 supports every major JavaScript build system, and recently became a Sprockets 4.0 default. The new website and documentation has had tens of thousands of page views, and has been featured by several publications including JavaScript Weekly.

We’re just getting started.

6to5’s mission is to take future versions of JavaScript compiling them into JavaScript you can run today in a way that is spec compliant, performant, and readable. With built-in support for JSX and Flow Types, it provides a lot more than other transpilers.

More than anything we want to eliminate any barriers to ES6+ adoption.

6to5 may be the most feature-ready ES6 transpiler out there right now, but there are some great projects that are attempting to do the same. Traceur Compiler is the most common alternative and also the most different as it relies heavily on a runtime. Then there are a bunch of other alternatives which take a much more similar approach to 6to5, such as es6-transpiler, es6now, jstransform, and [esnext](https://esnext.github.io/esnext/).

esnext in particular has an extremely similar set of goals as 6to5. With a focus on creating a smarter transpiler which can create higher quality ES5-compatible output. Both projects are extremely easy to get started with, and both care very deeply about creating the very best tool for developers.

A few weeks back, Stefan Penner of esnext reached out to us hoping that, because we share the same mission, we might be able to unite our efforts. Excited by the idea we quickly scheduled a meeting to discuss what that might mean.

The meeting went well.

We have decided that because of our shared goals and philosophy that it only makes sense to merge the two projects in order to build a much better transpiler.

So what will this mean for both projects?

The esnext team will start work on 6to5 bringing their skillset and experience in order to make it much faster and more spec-compliant. We’ll be putting in the effort to migrate people from esnext to 6to5, and we’ve already ported all of the esnext tests to 6to5 to ensure nothing will break.

> Ember CLI users (currently using esnext) can expect 6to5 to become installed by default replacing esnext.

You can expect us to continue working on 6to5 finding ways to grow and refine. We hope that others will join us in our efforts so that our energy can be spent improving rather the competing.
