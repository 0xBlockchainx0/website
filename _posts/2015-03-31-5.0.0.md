---

In the past few months Babel has been welcomed into several major communities
such as Node, React, Ember, Backbone, Angular, Rails, and many others. We
launched the [Users page](/users) only a few weeks ago and it's really cool to
see everyone that is using it. Companies like CloudFlare, Netflix, Mozilla, and
Yahoo!. Projects like Ghost, Atom, Mapbox, and so many more.

We've seen tons of blog posts, talks, events, courses all about ES6+ using
Babel, and official Babel tools have been downloaded nearly 2 million times.

Today we are making by far the largest release of Babel ever.

**If you're upgrading from Babel 4.x please see the
[breaking changes](#breaking-changes)**.

This release includes the new ES7 proposals:

- [Decorators](https://github.com/wycats/javascript-decorators)
- [Class properties](https://gist.github.com/jeffmo/054df782c05639da2adb)
- [Export extensions](https://github.com/leebyron/ecmascript-more-export-from)

The entire internal traversal and transformation pipeline has undergone a
rewrite that substantially increases flexibility and will allow many future
pipeline performance optimisations.

This release also brings a plugin API, this allows consumers to plug in their
own custom transformers to utilise the powerful transformation mechanisms that
Babel has to offer.

You can view the complete CHANGELOG
[here](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#500).

And as usual **if you run into any regressions please report them immediately**.

### TC39 Process

In this release you'll start to see us aligned with the
[TC39 process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QbEE0BsO4lvl7NFTn5WXWeiEIBfaVUF7Dk0hpPpPDzU).
The TC39 is the technical committee from ECMA that writes the ECMAScript
standard. Their process is categorised into 5 stages:

 - Stage 0 - Strawman
 - Stage 1 - Proposal
 - Stage 2 - Draft
 - Stage 3 - Candidate
 - Stage 4 - Finished

Proposals that are **stage 2 or above** are enabled in Babel by default. Now
this does not mean that they're guaranteed to be included in future ECMAScript
specifications or even Babel itself. Stage 2 is considered a good point for
inclusion by default in Babel due to their relative maturity and need for
critical proposal feedback.

Now let's dive into the changes we made to 5.0.

## New Proposals

### Stage 0: Class Properties

[Jeff Morrison's](https://github.com/jeffmo) stage 0
[class property initializers proposal](https://gist.github.com/jeffmo/054df782c05639da2adb)
fills the void of property composition on classes. These are analogous with the
class properties example listed in the
[React 0.13 beta announcement](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/01/27/react-v0.13.0-beta-1.html#es7-property-initializers).

**Example:**

```js
class Person {
  firstName = "Sebastian";
  static lastName = "McKenzie";
}

assert(new Foo().firstName, "Sebastian");
assert(Foo.lastName, "McKenzie");
```

**Usage:**

```js
require("babel").transform("code", {
  optional: ["es7.exportExtensions"]
});
// or
require("babel").transform("code", { stage: 1 });
```

```sh
$ babel --optional es7.classProperties script.js
# or
$ babel --stage 0 script.js
```

### Stage 1: Decorators

[Yehuda Katz'](https://github.com/wycats) stage 1
[decorators proposal](https://github.com/wycats/javascript-decorators) allows
you to elegantly compose property descriptors and metadata decoration. In the
future this will allow the powerful
[Ember Object Model](http://guides.emberjs.com/v1.10.0/object-model/classes-and-instances/)
to easily be represented with native classes.

**Example:**

```js
function concat(...args) {
  let sep = args.pop();

  return function(target, key, descriptor) {
    descriptor.initializer = function() {
      return args.map(arg => this[arg]).join(sep);
    }
  }
}

function autobind(target, key, descriptor) {
  var fn = descriptor.value;
  delete descriptor.value;
  delete descriptor.writable;
  descriptor.get = function () {
    return this[key] = fn.bind(this);
  };
}

class Person {
  firstName = "Sebastian";
  lastName = "McKenzie";

  @concat("firstName", "lastName", " ") fullName;
  @concat("lastName", "firstName", ", ") formalName;

  @autobind
  getFullName() {
    return `${this.first} ${this.last}`;
  }
}

assert(new Person().fullName, "Sebastian McKenzie");
assert(new Person().formalName, "McKenzie, Sebastian");
assert(new Person().getFullName.call(null), "Sebastian McKenzie");
```

**Usage:**

```js
require("babel").transform("code", {
  optional: ["es7.decorators"]
});
// or
require("babel").transform("code", { stage: 1 });
```

```sh
$ babel --optional es7.decorators script.js
# or
$ babel --stage 1 script.js
```

### Stage 1: Export Extensions

[Lee Byron's](https://github.com/leebyron) stage 1
[additional export-from statements proposal](https://github.com/leebyron/ecmascript-more-export-from)
completes the symmetry between import and export statement, allowing you to
easily export namespaces and defaults from external modules.

**Exporting a default**

```js
export foo from "bar";
```

equivalent to:

```js
import { foo as _foo } from "bar";
export { _foo as default };
```

**Exporting a namespace**

```js
export * as ns from "mod";
```

equivalent to:

```js
import * as _ns from "mod";
export { _ns as ns };
```

**Usage:**

```js
require("babel").transform("code", {
  optional: ["es7.exportExtensions"]
});
// or
require("babel").transform("code", { stage: 1 });
```

```sh
$ babel --optional es7.exportExtensions script.js
# or
$ babel --stage 1 script.js
```

## React Optimisations

In preparation for React 0.14, Babel sports some optimisation transformers for
JSX.

<blockquote class="babel-callout babel-callout-warning">
  <h4>Not ready</h4>
  <p>
    These <strong>should not</strong> be used pre-0.14 due to the necessary
    React changes required to treat ReactElements as value types. They also
    require more vetting to ensure their stability in production.
  </p>
</blockquote>

### [Constant Elements](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/3226)

Starting with 0.14 ReactElements and their props objects can be treated as as
value types. i.e. any instance is conceptually equivalent if all their values
are the same.

Take this function for example:

```js
import React from "react";

function render() {
  return <div className="foo" />;
}
```

This can be optimized by moving the JSX out of the function body so that each
time it is called the same instance is returned:

```js
import React from "react";

var _ref = <div className="foo" />;

function render() {
  return _ref;
}
```

Not only does it allow us to reuse the same objects, React will automatically
bail out any reconciliation of constant components - without a manual
`shouldComponentUpdate`.

**Usage:**

```javascript
require("babel").transform("code", {
  optional: ["optimisation.react.constantElements"]
});
```

```sh
$ babel --optional optimisation.react.constantElements script.js
```

### [Inline Elements](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/3228)

Starting with React 0.14 ReactElements can be inlined:

```javascript
<div className="foo">{bar}<Baz key="baz" /></div>
```

as objects:

```javascript
{ type: 'div', props: { className: 'foo', children:
  [ bar, { type: Baz, props: { }, key: 'baz', ref: null } ]
}, key: null, ref: null }
```

This improves performance over the existing `React.createElement` call by
inlining the result of it.

**Usage:**

```javascript
require("babel").transform("code", {
  optional: ["optimisation.react.inlineElements"]
});
```

```sh
$ babel --optional optimisation.react.inlineElements script.js
```

## .babelrc

Babel 5.0.0 has support for `.babelrc` out of the box across its **entire**
range of integrations. This means that it will work across
[`babel/register`](/docs/usage/register),
[`babel-node`](/docs/usage/cli#babel-node) as well as across the entire range
of build system plugins and module loaders such as
[`babel-loader`](https://github.com/babel/babel-loader),
[`babelify`](https://github.com/babel/babelify), and others.

`.babelrc` is equivalent to JSHint's [`.jshintrc`](http://jshint.com/docs/) and
JSCS' [`.jscsrc`](http://jscs.info/overview.html).

```json
{
  "stage": 1,
  "ignore": [
    "foo.js",
    "bar/**/*.js"
  ]
}
```

See the [docs](/docs/usage/babelrc) for more info.

## Plugin API

5.0.0 also introduces the long anticipated plugin API. This allows you to hook
into the powerful traversal and transformation internals of Babel. See the
[docs](/docs/usage/plugins) for more info.

<h1 id="breaking-changes" class="babel-blog-section-title">Breaking Changes</h1>

### Experimental Option

The `experimental` option has been **removed**. Fear not though, there is a
replacement. Babel now categories the ES7 transformers by
[TC39 stages](#tc39-changes).

tl;dr If you're using the `experimental` option, simply change it to
`$ babel --stage 0` or `{ stage: 0 }`.

> **Reminder:** Proposals that are **stage 2 or above** are enabled by default.

**Stage 0**

 - `es7.classProperties`
 - `es7.comprehensions`

**Stage 1**

 - `es7.asyncFunctions`
 - `es7.decorators`
 - `es7.exportExtensions`
 - `es7.objectRestSpread`

**Stage 2** (Stage 2 and above are enabled by default)

 - `es7.exponentiationOperator`

For a list of all current ES7 proposals please see the
[tc39/ecma262 repo](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262).

### `returnUsedHelpers` option

The `returnUsedHelpers` option has been renamed to `metadataUsedHelpers` and the returning result
object has been changed from `usedHelpers` to `metadata.usedHelpers`.

### Class Changes

5.0.0 introduces some updated derived class semantics that are long overdue.

`super()` **must** be called in a derived class constructor.

```js
class Foo extends Bar {
  constructor() {
    // no `super();`
  }
}
```

Access to `this` before `super()` in a derived class constructor is **not**
allowed.

```js
class Foo extends Bar {
  constructor() {
    this.foo; // `this` access before `super();`
    super();
  }
}
```

`super()` is **only** allowed in derived class constructors.

```js
class Foo {
  constructor() {
    super(); // not in a derived constructor
  }
}
```

## Removed Features

- The playground has been removed so development can be focussed on mainstream
ES features and proposals. This also reduces the risk of syntactic conflicts
preventing certain official features from being implemented.
- [Abstract references](https://github.com/zenparsing/es-abstract-refs) have
been removed as the proposal has been superseded. Support for one or more of the
superseding proposals may be implemented in the future.

---

In closing, we hope that you are now as excited about this release as we are.
There's a lot that went into it, and we believe this will set us up for a long
time into the future.
