**If you're upgrading from Babel 4.x please see the [breaking changes](#breaking-changes)**

This release includes the new ES7 proposals: [decorators](https://github.com/wycats/javascript-decorators), [class properties](https://gist.github.com/jeffmo/054df782c05639da2adb) and [export extensions](https://github.com/leebyron/ecmascript-more-export-from).

The entire internal traversal and transformation pipeline has overgone a rewrite that substantially increases
flexibility and will allow many future pipeline performance optimisations.

This release also brings a plugin API, this allows consumers to plug in their own custom transformers to utilise
the powerful transformation mechanisms that Babel has to offer.

You can view the complete CHANGELOG [here](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#500).

And as usual **if you run into any regressions please report them immediately**.

# New features

## New proposals

### Stage 0: Class properties

[Jeff Morrison's](https://github.com/jeffmo) stage 0 [class property initializers proposal](https://gist.github.com/jeffmo/054df782c05639da2adb) fills the void of property composition on classes. These are analagous with the class properties example listed in the [React 0.13 beta announcement](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/01/27/react-v0.13.0-beta-1.html#es7-property-initializers)

```javascript
class Person {
  firstName = "Sebastian";
  static lastName = "McKenzie";
}

assert(new Foo().firstName, "Sebastian");
assert(Foo.lastName, "McKenzie");
```

**Usage:**

```javascript
require("babel").transform("code", {
  optional: ["es7.exportExtensions"]
});
// or
require("babel").transform("code", { stage: 1 });
```

```sh
$ babel --optional es7.classProperties script.js
# or
$ babel --stage 0 script.js
```

--------

### Stage 1: Decorators

[Yehuda Katz'](https://github.com/wycats) stage 1 [decorators proposal](https://github.com/wycats/javascript-decorators) allows you to elegantly compose property descriptors and metadata decoration. In the future this will allow the powerful [Ember Object Model](http://guides.emberjs.com/v1.10.0/object-model/classes-and-instances/) to easily be represented with native classes.

```javascript
function concat(...args) {
  let sep = args.pop();

  return function(target, key, descriptor) {
    descriptor.initializer = function() {
      return args.map(arg => this[arg]).join(sep);
    }
  }
}

function autobind(target, key, descriptor) {
  var fn = descriptor.value;
  delete descriptor.value;
  delete descriptor.writable;
  descriptor.get = function () {
    return this[key] = fn.bind(this);
  };
}

class Person {
  firstName = "Sebastian";
  lastName = "McKenzie";

  @concat("firstName", "lastName", " ") fullName;
  @concat("lastName", "firstName", ", ") formalName;

  @autobind
  getFullName() {
    return `${this.first} ${this.last}`;
  }
}

assert(new Person().fullName, "Sebastian McKenzie");
assert(new Person().formalName, "McKenzie, Sebastian");
assert(new Person().getFullName.call(null), "Sebastian McKenzie");
```

**Usage:**

```javascript
require("babel").transform("code", {
  optional: ["es7.decorators"]
});
// or
require("babel").transform("code", { stage: 1 });
```

```sh
$ babel --optional es7.decorators script.js
# or
$ babel --stage 1 script.js
```

--------

### Stage 1: Export extensions

[Lee Byron's](https://github.com/leebyron) stage 1 [additional export-from statements proposal](https://github.com/leebyron/ecmascript-more-export-from) completes the symmetry between import and export statement, allowing you to easily export namespaces and defaults from external modules.

**Exporting a default**

```javascript
export foo from "bar";
```

equivalent to:

```javascript
import { foo as _foo } from "bar";
export { _foo as default };
```

**Exporting a namespace**

```javascript
export * as ns from "mod";
```

equivalent to:

```javascript
import * as _ns from "mod";
export { _ns as ns };
```

**Usage:**

```javascript
require("babel").transform("code", {
  optional: ["es7.exportExtensions"]
});
// or
require("babel").transform("code", { stage: 1 });
```

```sh
$ babel --optional es7.exportExtensions script.js
# or
$ babel --stage 1 script.js
```

## React optimisations

In preparation for React 0.14, Babel sports some optimisation transformers for JSX.

<blockquote class="babel-callout babel-callout-warning">
  <h4>Not ready</h4>
  <p>
    These <strong>should not</strong> be used pre-0.14 due to the necessary React changes required to
    treat ReactElements as value types. They also require more vetting to ensure their stability in
    production.
  </p>
</blockquote>

### [Constant elements](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/3226)

Starting with 0.14 ReactElements and their props objects can be treated as as value types. i.e. any instance
is conceptually equivalent if all their values are the same.

Take this function for example:

```javascript
import React from "react";

function render() {
  return <div className="foo" />;
}
```

This can be optimized by moving the JSX out of the function body so that each time it is called the same instance
is returned:

```javascript
import React from "react";

var _ref = <div className="foo" />;

function render() {
  return _ref;
}
```

Not only does it allow us to reuse the same objects, React will automatically bail out any reconciliation
of constant components - without a manual `shouldComponentUpdate`.

**Usage:**

```javascript
require("babel").transform("code", {
  optional: ["optimisation.react.constantElements"]
});
```

```sh
$ babel --optional optimisation.react.constantElements script.js
```

--------

### [Inline elements](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/3228)

Starting with React 0.14 ReactElements can be inlined:

```javascript
<div className="foo">{bar}<Baz key="baz" /></div>
```

as objects:

```javascript
{ type: 'div', props: { className: 'foo', children:
  [ bar, { type: Baz, props: { }, key: 'baz', ref: null } ]
}, key: null, ref: null }
```

This improves performance over the existing `React.createElement` call by inlining the result of it.

**Usage:**

```javascript
require("babel").transform("code", {
  optional: ["optimisation.react.inlineElements"]
});
```

```sh
$ babel --optional optimisation.react.inlineElements script.js
```

--------

## .babelrc

Babel 5.0.0 has support for `.babelrc` out of the box across it's **entire** range of integrations. This means
that it will work across [`babel/register`](/docs/usage/register), [`babel-node`](/docs/usage/cli#babel-node) as
well as across the entire range of build system plugins and module loaders such as
[`babel-loader`](https://github.com/babel/babel-loader) and [`babelify`](https://github.com/babel/babelify).

`.babelrc` is equivalent to JSHint's [`.jshintrc`](http://jshint.com/docs/) and JSCS' [`.jscsrc`](http://jscs.info/overview.html).

```json
{
  "stage": 1,
  "ignore": [
    "foo.js",
    "bar/**/*.js"
  ]
}
```

See the [docs](/docs/usage/babelrc) for more info.

## Plugin API

5.0.0 also introduces the long anticipated plugin API. This allows you to hook into the powerful traversal and
transformation internals of Babel. See the [docs](/docs/usage/plugins) for more info.

# Breaking changes

## Experimental option

The `experimental` option has been **removed**. Fear not though, there is a replacement. Babel now categories
the ES7 transformers by TC39 stages.

tl;dr If you're using the `experimental` option, simply change it to `$ babel --stage 0` or `{ stage: 0 }`.

ECMAScript proposals are categorised into 4 stages:

 - Stage 0 - Strawman
 - Stage 1 - Proposal
 - Stage 2 - Draft
 - Stage 3 - Candidate
 - Stage 4 - Finished

Proposals that are **stage 2 or above** are enabled by default. Now this does not mean that they're guaranteed
to be included in future ECMAScript specifications or even Babel itself. Stage 2 is considered a good point
for inclusion by default in Babel due to their relative maturity and need for critical proposal feedback.

**Stage 0**

 - `es7.classProperties`
 - `es7.comprehensions`

**Stage 1**

 - `es7.asyncFunctions`
 - `es7.decorators`
 - `es7.exportExtensions`
 - `es7.objectRestSpread`

**Stage 2** (Stage 2 and above are enabled by default)

 - `es7.exponentiationOperator`

For a list of all current ES7 proposals please see the [tc39/ecma262 repo](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262).

## Class changes

5.0.0 introduces some updated derived class semantics that are long overdue.

 - `super()` **must** be called in a derived class constructor.

   ```javascript
   class Foo extends Bar {
    constructor() {
      // no `super();`
    }
   }
   ```

 - Access to `this` before `super()` in a derived class constructor is **not** allowed.

   ```javascript
   class Foo extends Bar {
    constructor() {
      this.foo; // `this` access before `super();`
      super();
    }
   }
   ```

 - `super()` is **only** allowed in derived class constructors.

   ```javascript
   class Foo {
    constructor() {
      super(); // not in a derived constructor
    }
   }
   ```

## Removed features

 - The playground has been removed so development can be focussed on mainstream ES features and proposals. This also reduces the risk of syntactic conflicts preventing certain official features from being implemented.
 - [Abstract references](https://github.com/zenparsing/es-abstract-refs) have been removed as the proposal has been superseded. Support for one or more of the superseding proposals may be implemented in the future.
